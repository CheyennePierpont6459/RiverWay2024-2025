The owner has asked that we make them an app.
It will have a digital map that they have created of the river on it as well as safety information. 
Every year they get more phone calls of paddlers being confused and scared and needing directions or in some cases emergency services. 
The customers will be able to click a button and enter there approximate or precise location that will be sent to CCC. 
It also can be forwarded to emergency services If needed. Making getting to them faster, safer, and less time consuming.
This is the map that Cave Country Canoes has kindly provided us and will be used inside the app
